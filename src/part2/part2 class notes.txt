17. OOP Inheritance: Is A relation (super/sub  or  parent/child)
                     
                     less codes
                     reusability
                     organized
                     less memory
                     Centralize structure
                     easy to maintain


             sub (child) class: inherits all the variabels and methods from the super class

             super (parent) class: does not inherit anything. ONLY contains common features of all sub classes


             extends
             implements

             this()
             super()

             super.

        In my framework:

                BasePage: parent of all the pages classes  (Junit)

                        common web elements

                        public BasePage(){
                                initElement
                        }




                TestBase: parent of all the test classes for @Test methods  (TestNG)

                        @BeforeMethod{
                                open browser
                                maxmize browser
                                implicitwait
                                nevigate to URL
                        }

                        @AfterMethod{
                                close browser
                        }



                TestClass1 extends TestBase

                TestClass2 extends TestBase

                ....



18. Method Overriding: giving different implementatiosn to the methods
                        Must happen in sub class
                        Returntype, parameters, method name must be same
                        Access modifier needs to be same of more visible

                        private, static, final methods can not be overriden


                        toString()

                        get()
                        takeScreenshot()
                        executeScript()


19. Final keyword: unchangable
        
        methods: can not be overriden

        variables: can not be re-assigned

        class: can not be inherited



20 & 21. OOP Abstraction: hiding the implementation
                     focus on essentials, not to worry about small details

                     abstract methods: method without the body
                                       implementation of the method will be given when its overriden

                     2 ways:
                        1. Abstract class: meant to be a parent class (for common feature of all classes)
                                                can not create object


                        2. Interface:  used for providing additional methods
                                        implements

                                        can not create object

                                        variable: variables are static and final by default

                                        methods: abstract, static,  default methods


                In my framework: 

                        abstarct class: BasePage

                        interface: 
                                Map, List, Set....
                                WebDriver, JavScriptExecuter....



22. OOP Polymorphism: object taking on Multiple forms
                
                        Parent type (class/interface) being reference to child type

                        Only the Reference type' variable and methods can be accessed


                        In my framework:

                                ChromeDriver chromeDriver = = new ChromeDriver()
                                            chromeDriver.takeScreenShot()
                                            chomeDriver.executeScript()
                                            ...

                                FireFoxDriver firefoxDriver

                                ....
                                           ||
                                           ||

                                WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver()


                        Map map = new HashMap

                        Collection



23. Reference Type Castings: When there is Inheritance relations between the types
        
        upcasting: smaller reference type to larger (implicitly done)

        downcasting: larger reference type to smaller


        WebDriver driver = new FireFoxDriver();

        ( (TakeScreenShot)driver).takeScreenShot()

        ( (JavaScriptExecuter)driver).executeScript()



24. Exceptions: 
        
        Error: Due to the system issues

        Exception: Issues within the source code

                checked exceptions: compile time exception

                unchecked exception: runtime exceptions


        Exceptiosn that i have faced:
                NullpointerException
                TimeOutException
                NoSuchElementException
                StaleElementException
                ClassCastException
                WebDriverException
                ...


25. Exception Handling
        checked exception:
                try & catch
                throws

        unchecked exception:
                try & catch


        try & catch:

                try{
                   exception code
                }catch(ExceptionType e){
                    printStackTrace()
                }finally{

                }


        throws: within signature of methods.



 26. final vs finally vs finalize:

        final: keyword

        finally: block

        finalize: method


27. garbage collection & garbage collector:

        garbage collection: collection of unrefrenced objects

        garbage collector: process of removing the objects that are eligible for gabrage collection



        driver = new ChromeDriver()

        driver = new FireFoxDriver()

        driver = null



28. Collections: size is dynamic
                 only supports non-primitives
                 Ready methods


                 List: allow duplicates, has index. 

                        ArrayList: faster (retriving). array based class.

                        LinkedList: node based class. removing & inserting tehe elemnbt is faster

                        Vector: Syncrhonized

                        stack: Syncrhonized . LIFO



                        In my fraemwork:
                                List of WebElements --> findElements
                                list of maps --> List<Map<String, Object>>



                 Set: does not allow duplicates, deos not have index

                        HashSet: faster. random order

                        linkedHashSet: insertion order

                        TreeSet: sorted order


                        In my fraemwork:
                                window handlings--> getwindowHandles()
